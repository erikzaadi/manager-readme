# LEAP Process

> LEAP: Leadership Evaluation and Performance

Bi-yearly leadership growth and alignment program for team leaders.

The LEAP process provides a consistent structure for growth conversations with first line managers.  
It mirrors the PEP structure, but focuses on leadership, team health, ownership, clarity, cross-team collaboration and execution.

LEAP is **not a performance evaluation, rating, or compensation input**.  
Its purpose is growth, alignment and clarity, not judgment.

LEAP is both reflective and directional, culminating in a shared understanding of the team leader’s leadership aspiration and focus areas for the upcoming cycle, as captured in the LEAP template.

In the context of LEAP, a _cycle_ refers to the period between two LEAP conversations, typically spanning six months and aligned with the bi-yearly cadence of the process.

The LEAP template is shared two weeks in advance, together with a calendar invite for a 90 minute conversation.

## Objectives of the Process

The objectives below are intended to be viewed holistically rather than as a checklist.

1. Create space for structured reflection for every team leader  
2. Strengthen leadership capabilities and self-awareness  
3. Improve team health, clarity of mission and execution patterns  
4. Provide a bidirectional feedback loop between group manager and team leader  
5. Maintain accountability to quarterly metrics and outcomes, using them as signals rather than a scorecard  
6. Reinforce effective cross-team collaboration and product partnership  
7. Set aligned leadership goals and priorities for the next cycle

## Cadence

- Runs twice a year, aligned with the IC PEP cycle  
- Metrics are reviewed quarterly as part of the process  
- The team leader completes their preparation before the conversation  

---

## Pre Work

The intent of pre work is reflection, not perfection.  
Short, honest bullet points are enough. In most sections, 2–4 bullets is sufficient.

1. The team leader fills the self-reflection, team health and metrics sections of the LEAP template  
2. The group manager gathers lightweight 360-style feedback from peers, PM partners and relevant stakeholders  
3. The group manager fills the feedback to the team leader section  
4. Both sides gather questions or discussion points  
5. A 90 minute meeting is scheduled

## During the Conversation

- Begin with the team leader’s self-reflection  
- Explore team health, identity, execution and cross-team collaboration  
- Review product partnership dynamics and their impact on clarity and outcomes  
- Deep dive into quarterly metrics and interpret the stories and trade-offs behind them  
- Exchange feedback in both directions  
- Align on leadership focus areas, team priorities and product-facing goals for the next cycle  
- Document key insights, decisions and commitments directly in the template  

---

## After the Conversation

1. Finalize the summary section together  
2. Translate agreed goals into the relevant tracking systems (Notion, quarterly plans, HiBob, etc.)  
3. Use quarterly check-ins to review metrics, product alignment and leadership progress  
4. Reference the previous LEAP in the next cycle to track progress and close the loop

## Principles of the LEAP

- Growth is a shared responsibility  
- Feedback is mutual  
- Reflection matters more than perfection  
- Metrics provide grounding, not judgment  
- Strong product partnership and cross-team collaboration amplify team impact  
- Alignment creates momentum  
- Sustainable leadership requires a sustainable pace
