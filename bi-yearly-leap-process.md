# LEAP Process  

> LEAP: Leadership Evolution and Performance

Bi-yearly leadership growth and alignment program for team leaders.

The LEAP process provides a consistent structure for growth conversations with first line managers.  
It mirrors the PEP structure, but focuses on leadership, team health, ownership, clarity, cross team collaboration and execution.

LEAP is not only reflective but also directional, culminating in a shared understanding of the team leader’s leadership aspiration and focus areas for the upcoming cycle, as captured in the LEAP template.

In the context of LEAP, a _"cycle"_ refers to the period between two LEAP conversations, typically spanning six months and aligned with the bi-yearly cadence of the process.

[LEAP Template](./bi-yearly-leap-template.md), sent two weeks beforehand together with a calendar invite for a 90 minute meeting.

## Objectives of the Process

The objectives below are intended to be viewed holistically rather than as a checklist.

1. Create space for structured reflection for every team leader  
2. Strengthen leadership capabilities and self-awareness  
3. Improve team health, clarity of mission and execution patterns  
4. Provide a bidirectional feedback loop between group manager and team leader  
5. Maintain accountability to quarterly metrics and outcomes  
6. Reinforce effective cross team collaboration and product partnership  
7. Set aligned leadership goals and priorities for the next cycle

## Cadence

- Runs twice a year, aligned with the IC PEP cycle  
- Metrics are reviewed quarterly as part of the process  
- The team leader completes their sections before the conversation

## Pre Work

1. The team leader fills the self reflection, team health and metrics review sections of the LEAP template  
2. The group manager gathers 360 style feedback from peers, PM partners and other relevant stakeholders  
3. The group manager fills the feedback to the team leader section
4. Both gather questions or discussion points  
5. A 90 minute meeting is scheduled

## During the Conversation

- Begin with the team leader's self reflection  
- Explore team health, identity, cross team collaboration and leadership topics  
- Review product partnership dynamics and their impact on execution clarity and outcomes  
- Deep dive into the quarterly metrics and interpret the stories behind them  
- Exchange feedback both ways  
- Align leadership, team and product facing goals for the next cycle  
- Document key decisions and commitments directly in the template

## After the Conversation

1. Finalize the summary section  
2. Translate goals into the relevant tracking systems (Notion, quarterly plans or HiBob)  
3. Use quarterly check ins to review metrics, product alignment and leadership progress  
4. Reference the LEAP in the next cycle to track progress and close the loop

## Principles of the LEAP

- Growth is a shared responsibility  
- Feedback is mutual  
- Reflection matters more than perfection  
- Metrics provide grounding, not judgment  
- Strong product partnership and cross team collaboration amplify team impact  
- Alignment creates momentum
