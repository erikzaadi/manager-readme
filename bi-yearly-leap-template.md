# LEAP  

> LEAP: Leadership Evolution and Performance

Team leader growth and alignment conversation template

The LEAP is a bi-yearly structured conversation between the group manager and each team leader.  
It focuses on leadership development, team health, clarity of ownership, execution quality and alignment with org level goals.  

A _"cycle"_ refers to the period between two LEAP conversations, typically spanning six months and aligned with the bi-yearly cadence of the process.  

This document is prepared collaboratively ahead of the session and finalized together during the conversation.
