# LEAP – Leadership Evaluation and Performance

Bi-yearly leadership growth and alignment conversation

This LEAP document is a preparation aid for a leadership growth conversation, not a test or evaluation.  
Short, honest bullet points are more than enough, depth will be added together during the conversation.  
The goal is to reflect, surface patterns, and align on a small number of leadership and team focus areas for the next cycle, not to be exhaustive or polished.
