> LEAP: Leadership Evaluation and Performance

Team leader growth and alignment conversation template

The LEAP is a bi-yearly structured leadership conversation between a group manager and each team leader.
It focuses on leadership development, team health, clarity of ownership, execution quality and alignment with org level goals.  

A _"cycle"_ refers to the period between two LEAP conversations, typically spanning six months and aligned with the bi-yearly cadence of the process.  

This document is prepared collaboratively ahead of the session and finalized together during the conversation.

## Bottom Line

The outcome of LEAP is a shared understanding of:
- How you are showing up as a leader today
- What kind of leader you aspire to be
- A small, focused set of leadership and team goals for the next six months
