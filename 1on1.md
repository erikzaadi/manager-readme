# My Thoughts About 1:1 Meetings

## Cadence may vary

Could be 30 minutes every two weeks  
Could be more dynamic based on your needs  
We’ll adjust it together

## Content

### Sup?

This is the most important part  
I listen, you talk  
Whatever’s on your mind, let’s go there

### Feedback, both ways

A safe space for us both to share feedback  
Constructive, honest, and well meant

### FYIs

Any near-future things that might be useful for your context  
Think product shifts, team changes, or upcoming opportunities

### Personal Goals

Go through a document shared only between us [(this one)](./personal-goals-doc.md), connect feedback (mutual) to items in the document, think ahead of near future tasks that might be relevant.
