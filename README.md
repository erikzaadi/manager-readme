# Manager README ‚Äì Erik Zaadi

Whale hello there! üê≥  
I‚Äôm Erik. This README is a guide to how I work, what I value, and what you can expect when working with me.  
Think of it as an **instruction manual with a human touch**. It‚Äôs not static, I‚Äôll refine it as I learn and grow.

## Generic ‚Äì For Everyone  

### Philosophy  
I see myself as a **builder of builders**, my success comes through enabling others.  
I‚Äôm a big believer that **teamwork works**, enable the team, share the knowledge, and prevent SPOFs.  

### Values  
- Initiative & curiosity  
- Clarity & transparency  
- Collaboration & knowledge-sharing  
- Sustainability & balance  

### Communication  
- Prefer async (Slack/docs) over too many meetings.  
- Direct ping if urgent.  
- 1:1s are sacred space for you.  

### Availability  
My schedule can get hectic, but here‚Äôs how best to reach me:  
- **Emphasize urgency:** Mark clearly if it‚Äôs an FYI vs actionable. If actionable, I‚Äôll prioritize.  
- **Face-to-Face:** Grab me anytime for quick help. If I‚Äôm busy, I‚Äôll ask if it‚Äôs deferrable.  
- **Email:** Checked daily, replies usually within a day.  
- **Slack:** Direct mentions, a few hours.  
- **WhatsApp:** Fine for personal matters, checked as often as Slack.  
- **Phone Call:** If you call, I‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs urgent.  

### My Known Bugs üêû

Like any good system, I come with a few quirks you should know about:  
- **Teamwork or Bust:** Disrespect, turf wars, or ‚Äúsuccess at the expense of others‚Äù ticks me off.  
- **Feedback is a Gift:** I love giving feedback, please don‚Äôt make me repeat the same thing too often.  
- **Respect People‚Äôs Time:** Off-hours, punctuality, and timely updates matter.  
- **Technopath at Heart:** Coding/CI/infra/monitoring are still a big part of me. I might slip into ‚Äúsolution mode.‚Äù I‚Äôm opinionated, but open.  
- **Concentration Contrast:** Usually punny and positive, sometimes UBER-serious commander mode (esp. 2 AM incidents or when deeply focused). Jokes come back once the fire‚Äôs out.  
- **Family Man:** Dad in puns and in life. I‚Äôll be available for urgencies, but please respect family time.  
- **PPM Factor:** The longer a meeting runs, the higher my **Puns Per Minute**. Feel free to tell me when it‚Äôs too much.

## For ICs (Direct Reports)  

My job is to help you succeed, grow, and have an impact without unnecessary friction.  

### Expectations  
- **WFH:** I trust you to manage your schedule, just keep the team in the loop and stay within company policy.  
- **Vacations:** Take them, they matter. Give early notice.  
- **Learning:** It‚Äôs part of the job, not extra. Balance features with growth.  
- **TL as Non-Nudging Buffer:** I‚Äôll enable, not bottleneck. You control the ‚Äúfaucet‚Äù, if you want me more involved, just say so. It‚Äôs fine if this changes over time.  
- **1:1s:** Bi-weekly, ~30 min. About you, feedback, and growth, not task check-ins.  

### How We Work  
- **Personal Doc:** Co-created, goal-focused, done by our 3rd 1:1. Private to us.  
- **Meetings:**  
  - Bi-weekly 1:1s.  
  - Bi-monthly *Hackadelic* (team fun, can be related to work and perhaps not, name subject to puns).  
  - Bi-yearly *PEP* (Personal Evaluation Process, **NOT PIP**) , 1.5h deep two-way feedback and growth planning.  
- **Features vs. Learning:** We balance shipping and growing.  
- **Team Interaction:** Pairing encouraged, knowledge-sharing expected.
