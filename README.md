# Manager README – Erik Zaadi

Whale hello there! 🐳  
I’m Erik. This README is a guide to how I work, what I value, and what you can expect when working with me.  
Think of it as an **instruction manual with a human touch**. It’s not static, I’ll refine it as I learn and grow.

## Generic – For Everyone  

### Philosophy  
I see myself as a **builder of builders**, my success comes through enabling others.  
I’m a big believer that **teamwork works**, enable the team, share the knowledge, and prevent SPOFs.  

### Values  
- Initiative & curiosity  
- Clarity & transparency  
- Collaboration & knowledge-sharing  
- Sustainability & balance  

### Communication  
- Prefer async (Slack/docs) over too many meetings.  
- Direct ping if urgent.  
- 1:1s are sacred space for you.  

### Availability  
My schedule can get hectic, but here’s how best to reach me:  
- **Emphasize urgency:** Mark clearly if it’s an FYI vs actionable. If actionable, I’ll prioritize.  
- **Face-to-Face:** Grab me anytime for quick help. If I’m busy, I’ll ask if it’s deferrable.  
- **Email:** Checked daily, replies usually within a day.  
- **Slack:** Direct mentions, a few hours.  
- **WhatsApp:** Fine for personal matters, checked as often as Slack.  
- **Phone Call:** If you call, I’ll assume it’s urgent.  

Don't wait for our next 1:1 if you have anything urgent!  

### My Known Bugs 🐞

Like any good system, I come with a few quirks you should know about:  
- **Teamwork or Bust:** Disrespect, turf wars, or “success at the expense of others” ticks me off.  
- **Feedback is a Gift:** I love giving feedback, please don’t make me repeat the same thing too often.  
- **Respect People’s Time:** Off-hours, punctuality, and timely updates matter.  
- **Technopath at Heart:** Coding/CI/infra/monitoring are still a big part of me. I might slip into “hands-on solution mode.” I’m opinionated, but open.  
- **Concentration Contrast:** Usually punny and positive, sometimes UBER-serious commander mode (esp. 2 AM incidents or when deeply focused). Jokes come back once the fire’s out.  
- **Family Man:** Dad in puns and in life. I’ll be available for urgencies, but please respect family time.  
- **PPM Factor:** The longer a meeting runs, the higher my **Puns Per Minute**. Feel free to tell me when it’s too much.  

### Work-Life Balance 🌱  
Don’t work over hours. When it’s needed for an incident or something truly urgent, sure, else **manage your time to ensure you breathe and enjoy your private life**.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips

You’ll see me use the term _“faucet”_ throughout this doc. It’s my way of saying:  
You get to decide how much involvement or buffering you want from me.  

Need more help today? Just turn the _faucet_ up.  
Want more space tomorrow? Turn it down.  
Even if it changes daily, that’s totally OK.  

We’re all human, and it’s always fine to ask for more help or more independence. No need to overthink it.


## Templates & Rituals

I use structured rituals like PEP for ICs and LEAP (Leadership Evolution and Performance) for managers, so we have regular, honest checkpoints on growth, alignment and leadership impact.

Here are the documents and rituals that support how we work and grow together:

- [Intro Talk Checklist](./introduction-talk.md) – What we’ll go over when you first join  
- [1:1 Structure](./1on1.md) – Format and expectations for our regular syncs  
- [Skip-Level Meeting Format](./skip-level.md) – How I run skip-levels and what I want to learn  
- [Personal Goals Doc](./personal-goals-doc.md) – Your career growth sandbox  
- [PEP Process](./bi-yearly-pep-process.md) – Bi-yearly deep-dive on growth and feedback for ICs  
- [LEAP Process](./bi-yearly-leap-process.md) – Leadership Evolution and Performance, bi-yearly reflection and alignment for managers  


## For ICs (Direct Reports)  

My job is to help you succeed, grow, and have an impact without unnecessary friction.  

### Expectations  

- **WFH:** I trust you to manage your schedule, just keep the team in the loop and stay within company policy.  
- **Vacations:** Take them, they matter. Give early notice.  
- **Learning:** It’s part of the job, not extra. Balance features with growth.  
- **Manager as Non-Nudging Buffer:** I’ll enable, not bottleneck. You control the “faucet”, if you want me more involved, just say so. It’s fine if this changes over time.  
- **1:1s:** Bi-weekly, ~30 min. About you, feedback, and growth, not task check-ins.  

### How We Work  

- **Personal Doc:** Co-created, goal-focused, filled by our 3rd 1:1. Private to us.
    It captures your long-term aspirations, short-term goals, and personal interests much like a career dev sandbox.
- **Meetings:**  
  - Bi-weekly 1:1s.  
  - Bi-monthly *Hackadelic* (team fun, can be related to work or not, name subject to puns).  
  - Bi-yearly *PEP* (Personal Evaluation Process, **NOT PIP**),
    1.5h deep two-way feedback and growth planning.  
    You'll get a doc to prep ~2 weeks ahead, come as you are, it's a candid conversation.
- **Features vs. Learning:** We balance shipping and growing.  
- **Team Interaction:** Pairing encouraged, knowledge-sharing expected.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips  

- **Own your tasks:**  
  - If something is unclear, ask.  
  - Ownership doesn’t end with a merge, keep an eye on how your change behaves over time.  
  - If you stopped mid-task, could someone else continue?  
  - Raise flags early for spillovers or unexpected challenges.  
- Bottom-up tasks coming from you will always have a soft spot for me, raise issues you care about.  
- Strive to enable your teammates.  
- Have fun!  


## For Managers  

This section is for managers I manage directly.  

### Coaching & Development  

- **My Coaching:** I’ll support and coach you directly.  
- **Peer 2 Peer Coaching:** I expect you to coach each other as peers where applicable, hold each other accountable and give kudos, don't wait for others to give feedback.  
- **Skip Levels:** Monthly, 30 min with your reports, to hear directly from them.  
- **LEAP:** Twice a year we will run LEAP (Leadership Evolution and Performance), a structured reflection and feedback conversation focused on your leadership, your team’s health, and alignment with org level goals. LEAP is the manager-focused equivalent of the PEP for ICs, adapted for the realities of leading a team.

### Expectations  

- **Shared Ownership:** You own your team, I’ve got your back.  
- **No Surprises:** Raise issues early.  
- **Unified Progress:** Use dashboards/docs/TLDRs for async updates.  
- **Continuous Innovation:** Keep improving, not just delivering.  

### Communication  

- **1:1s:** About you, feedback, and growth, not tasks.  
- **The Faucet Analogy:** You control how involved I get. Dial it up/down as needed.  
- **Slack canvas:** Open place to put points to talk about in our upcoming 1:1.  

### Collaboration  

- **First Team Concept:** Your peers are your “first team.” Support them, lean on them.  
- **Ideas Welcome:** Bring them all, I’ll listen.  

### Growth & Feedback  

- **Career Ladder:** Your path forward matters.  
- **360 Feedback:** Bi-yearly, to reflect and grow.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips  

- **Relationships:** Connect with your PM and manager peers deeply. Enable them, lean on them for support.  
- **Own your time:** A burned-out manager helps no one. Invest in your well-being.  
- **There is no golden rule:** Management is chaotic and dynamic, build processes that help overcome the chaos.  
- **Have fun:** Management is serious work, but allow yourself to refresh with things you enjoy, whether that’s hands-on code or a good book.  


## For Peers  

This section is for my fellow engineering leaders. You are my **first team**.  

### How I See Us  

- **First Team First:** I’ll share openly and support you, expect the same back.  
- **Business Partners:** We succeed together, not in silos.  
- **Candor Always:** Direct feedback both ways. Silence isn’t an option.  

### How I Show Up  

- **Supportive:** From collaboration to a stress-relieving pun, I’ll aim to lighten the load.  
- **A Safe Ear:** I’m here for your rants, dilemmas, and stress.  
- **Collaborative:** I’ll work with you to solve cross-team challenges.  

### What I Expect  

- **Transparency:** Share risks and dependencies early.  
- **Feedback:** I’ll give it, and I want it back.  
- **Shared Accountability:** Debate is fine, but once we align, we row together, **same ship, same direction** ⚓.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips  

- I deal in puns and ideas, sometimes a lot of both. Always feel free to adjust the **faucet** if it’s too much.  


## For Product Peers  

This section is for my product counterparts (PMs, product directors, etc.).  

### Partnership Philosophy  

- EM ↔ PM is a true partnership, with shared ownership and different responsibilities. See the [LEAP](./bi-yearly-leap-template.md) template for how we reflect on this partnership.
- Trust and candor are non-negotiable.  

### How I Show Up  

- I bring transparency, technical depth, and team context.  
- I’ll challenge assumptions respectfully, with the goal of alignment.  
- I value clarity on scope, trade-offs, and sustainability.  

### What I Expect  

- Share openly: constraints, priorities, risks.  
- Debate is healthy, but once aligned, we move forward together.  
- We co-own outcomes, not just roadmaps.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips  

- I can be verbose, and I’ll have many ideas. Use the **faucet** to dial my involvement up or down as needed.  


## For CS & CSM  

This section is for my partners in Customer Success and Customer Support.  

### Philosophy  

Strong CS/R&D collaboration is critical, we’re on the same ship, making sure customers succeed.  

### How I Show Up  

- I’ll work to build a strong, trust-based relationship.  
- I’ll share early knowledge on features and changes, so you’re empowered to support customers.  
- I’ll listen closely to your feedback, it’s invaluable in shaping better features and processes.  

### What I Expect  

- Help us define clear SLAs together, so expectations are consistent.  
- Bring forward recurring pain points, I want us to solve them at the root.  
- Collaborate with us on scaling processes to support growth.  

### PragmaErik Survival Tips  

- **Translation:** I started out in support, but I’ve been in engineering a long time. If my communication isn’t clear, tell me!  


## Community  

I’m deeply involved in the tech community, it’s part of who I am.  

- Core team member of **[DevOpsDays Tel Aviv](https://tlvcommunity.dev/devopsdays)**.  
- Past involvement with **[Reversim conference](https://summit.reversim.com/)** (speaker & staff).  
- Regular speaker and participant in local (and some international) conferences.  
- Mentor to aspiring speakers within and outside places I've worked, for years.  

### How This Connects to You  

I believe in giving **others a stage**. For ICs and Managers:  
- I’ll encourage and support you in sharing your work publicly.  
- I’ll mentor you for talks and conferences if you’re interested.  
- I’ll promote you for opportunities that help your career grow.  


### Final Note  

If you’ve read this far, thank you! Now let’s go build something great (and probably punny).
