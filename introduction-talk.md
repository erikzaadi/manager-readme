- [ ] My working style, guided by the Manager README
- [ ] WFH and flexibility expectations
- [ ] Vacations and reserves — just keep me in the loop
- [ ] Learning as part of the job
- [ ] Manager as a non-nudging buffer
- [ ] 1:1 cadency and preferences
- [ ] Personal doc, we'll co-build it together
- [ ] Meetings cadence: 1:1s, Hackadelic, etc.
- [ ] Features vs Learning balance
