# PEP (Personal Evaluation Process) 

_Yes, it's funny since it sounds like a **PEP** talk._

A bi yearly process that helps focus feedback, measurements and career goals over time.

## 1st PEP Guide

Send the [PEP Template](./bi-yearly-pep-template.md) 2 weeks in before hand, together with an invite for a meeting (1.5) hours.

_TIP_: Strive **NOT** to postpone this meeting

Ask the target person to fill in the document, OR, if that person feels more comfortable, a copy.

### At the actual meeting

We go through the document in 3 phases:

1. The person gives their thoughts about everything EXCEPT for the short term measurements
2. The manager gives their thoughts about each item EXCEPT for the short term measurements

   _TIP_: Write in _italic_ or a different color to diffrentiate who wrote what. Write in **BOLD** what you both agree on.  

3. Start articulating and agreeing on a **Title** and **Subtitle** describing the next position (and be very verbose about the why), then write explicit ways to measure in the near quarter that you're on the correct way.

### Metric Strategy: 

* 2 quantifiable goals (e.g., “Lead 2 projects,” “Influence 3 cross-team standards”)
* 1 feel-based metric (e.g., “Feels more confident leading large meetings”)

## Nth (not first) PEP

Go over the previous document and measurements for a quick recap before going over the new one.

## The 2 most important parts:

### Actually defining an explicit title

Depending on your organization policies, you can (or can't) work on a title that might not be available for that person (or at all) in the near future in our organization.

That's okay, the reasoning is that you're dealing with the **LOGICAL** next step in their career ladder, thus giving that person tools to reach that goal, even if it's not within the current organizations near future helps both the person and the organization, in the fact that we establish a context for continuous feedback AND for creating new opportunities .

### The measurements

Having extremely simply but explicit metrics is **EVERYTHING**, this is what you'll follow up on, and this goes both ways:

* Affect at least 3 cross team standards
* Lead at least two projects

In this example, having the opportunity to actually lead a project is also the organizations effort.

## One last note

These talks can be **VERY** emotional, especially if there's important and deep feedback that needs to be given (in either direction).  
Remaining calm, keep a glass of water near and plow through to get the result **IS WORTH IT**.  
Don’t rush. Follow up a day later if needed to ensure alignment and give space for reflection.  
As a leader, it's **YOUR** responsibility to be both pragmatic and inspire vision..  
This is far from easy, and just as the person receiving the process, you as a manager **MUST** prepare accordingly as well.  
This includes getting 360 feedback from peers, cross team and external functions that had interactions with the person being PEP'd.
